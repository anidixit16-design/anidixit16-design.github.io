                My dearest *Nidhi*, Happy Birthday! I made this just for you, a scroll of love and memories for your special day, September 20th, 2025. You are the light that makes every day brighter, the laughter that fills my life, and the quiet comfort I always come home to. Today, and every day, is about celebrating the incredible person you are. Thank you for simply being you.
            </p>
